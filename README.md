## Main Objective

Develop a web-based solution to automate the process of UML based assessment management and plagiarism checking tool to minimize academic dishonesty.

## Main Research Questions

-There isn't any software tool for plagiarism calculation of UML diagrams
-Unavailability of UML Diagram correction checking tool.
-Manual UML diagram plagiarism and correctness checking is prone to error.
-Time cunsumption while creating model answers for UML based assignments manually.

## Individual Research Questions

1. IT19070704 - Weerasinghe D.N.H
    - There isn't any particular system to capture plagarism in class diagram.
    - Capturing class diagram plagiarism Manually prone to error and consume time.
    
2. IT19079264 - Jayasith H.B.C
    - Important to have use case diagram plagiarism detecting feature in the plagiarism detection tools. 
    - Current plagiarism detection tools fail to detect plagiarism of a use case diagram.
    - Capturing usecase diagram plagiarism Manually prone to error and consume time.

3. IT19076362 - Thiwanka K.A.T
    - To check the answers, assesment panel has to have a model answer with all essential componets.
    - Model answer must be created manually and evaluated by the panel and to identify errors, missing components. which is time consuming.
    - Manually checking student answers is also time-consuming and prone to errors.
    - Students make errors often when extracting information from scenarios and those errors should be identified manually.
    
4. IT19041926 - Onella Natalie P.A.D
    - There isn't any particular sytem which  can check synonyms of class diagrams and usecase diagrams.
    - Unavailability of  automtically mark student  answer diagrams and plagiarism calculation.

    - Identify relationships types between classes in diagram.
    - Identify the cardinality of relationships in diagram.

2. IT19079264 - Jayasith H.B.C
    - Identify the actors and use cases in the use case diagram
    - Identify the actors – use case relationship in the use case diagram.
    - Identify the use case – use case relationships in the use case diagram
    - Identify the Generalization relationship in the use case diagram.

3. IT19076362 - Thiwanka K.A.T
    - Generate the model answer UML diagrams from the question scenario to reduce the time consumption and minimize the errors.
    - Preprosess  question scenario and extract information
    - Extract UML components
    - Generate UML (Class and use case) diagrams using extracted components.
    
4. IT19041926 - Onella Natalie P.A.D
    - Compare the extracted components.
    - Similar words checking, when comparing the answer with model answer.
    - Calculate the correctness percentage.
    - Calculate a percentage for the plagiarism
